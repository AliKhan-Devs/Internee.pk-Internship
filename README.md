# 🎓 Internee.pk Virtual Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I developed as part of my **Virtual Internship with [Internee.pk](https://internee.pk/)**.  
Each project is structured as a **full-stack MERN application** (React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB) and documented professionally, following the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** approach.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **IMS/** → Internship Management System  
  - Complete project with `frontend/` and `backend/` directories  
  - Each subfolder includes its own README (setup & usage)  
  - Root-level IMS README provides project overview  

*(More projects will be added here as I progress in the internship.)*

## ✅ SDLC Approach
Each project in this repository follows the **SDLC phases**:
1. **Requirements (SRS)** – Defining functional & non-functional requirements.  
2. **Design** – ERD, high-level architecture, and sequence diagrams.  
3. **Implementation** – Full MERN stack code.  
4. **Testing** – Manual/functional testing.  
5. **Final Documentation** – Scalability, reliability options, and reflections.

## 📌 Future Projects
As part of this internship, more projects will be added here. Each will follow the same structure:
- **Project Overview (root README)**  
- **Frontend README**  
- **Backend README**

## 🙏 Acknowledgment
These projects are developed during my **Virtual Internship with Internee.pk**, where the focus is on learning through **real-world, practical projects** and applying professional **software engineering practices**.
